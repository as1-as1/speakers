FIX MY SPEAKER - Remove the Water From My Phone Speaker

<a href = "https://fixmyphonespeakers.com/posts/how-to-eject-water-out-of-your-phone-speaker/">Fix My Speaker</a> assists in the repair of your smartphone speaker by playing a low-frequency, high-frequency water removal sound at a frequency of 165Hz. A clever method for removing water and dust from your iPhone or Android phone's speakers.

What Happens If A Phone Falls In Water? Will It Get Damaged?
When a phone falls into water, the liquid fills the port, jack, and speaker. Water will pour into the circuits of a non-water-resistant phone, corroding the circuits, coils, and resistors if no action is done. It may also take time to break vulnerable components on a water-damaged phone, so it may not take effect right away.

Pro Tips for Checking If Your Phone Is Water or Dust Resistant?
The Ingress Protection code, often known as an IP rating, is used to determine a phone's water resistance. The IP rating of a gadget refers to its ability to withstand solid and liquid incursions.

There are two numbers in the IP rating. The first refers to dust resistance, whereas the second refers to liquid resistance, specifically water resistance.

If your phone has an IP68 rating, it implies it has a solid object protection of 6 (complete protection from dust, dirt, and sand) and a liquid protection of 8 (complete protection from water) (protected from immersion in water to a depth of more than one meter).

The IP68 grade is shared by the popular iPhone 13 and Samsung Galaxy S21 phones. While IP ratings indicate how water-resistant a phone is, swimming with most phones will get you into serious danger. Oceans and swimming pools contain salt, which can damage your phone and force you to replace it.

Check If Your Android or iPhone Has Been Water Damaged
A liquid contact/damage indicator strip is located within the SIM card tray on most Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, and other flagship phones. This is used to inspect a gadget for any liquid damage that could be causing it to malfunction. When an indicator strip is exposed to moisture, it loses its normal hue and becomes stained and smudgy.
